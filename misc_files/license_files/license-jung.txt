According to http://jung.sourceforge.net/faq.html, "JUNG is licensed
and made freely available under the Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD) license." This is confirmed by http://sourceforge.net/projects/jung.
However no license file is made available either on the website or
in any of the sources that can be downloaded.

Therefore we assume this definition from
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php; this should be
replaced by an actual license once one becomes available.
